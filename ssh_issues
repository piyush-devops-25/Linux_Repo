#sometimes we get this authentication issue when pushing content to git hence 

An SSH agent is like a secure memory assistant that runs in the background and remembers your SSH private key, so you don’t have to type your password (passphrase) every time you connect to a server or push code to GitHub.


| Step               | What Happens                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 **Start**       | You run `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` to **start** the agent process.                                             |
| 🔐 **Add Key**     | You run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to **load** your private key into the agent.                                 |
| 🧠 **Remember**    | The agent stores your key in memory (not on disk), so it's **secure** and **temporary**.                     |
| 🤝 **Use**         | When you do `git push` or SSH to a server, the agent **automatically provides the key** to authenticate you. |
| ⏳ **Session Ends** | The agent runs until you reboot, logout, or manually kill it. Then you'll need to add the key again.         |



1. Checks whether any SSH keys are currently loaded in the agent (your identity store).
   ssh-add -l

2. Starts the SSH agent, which runs in the background and holds your private keys in memory.
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

3. Adds your SSH private key to the agent so it can be used during Git operations.
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

4. Confirm it's added
   ssh-add -l


Then perfom this : 

git push -u origin main
